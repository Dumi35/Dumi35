## Hi there 👋

I’m a software engineer, particularly, a frontend engineer.

I've been exploring various tools for coding web pages because it's what I enjoy. I view UI designs as a puzzle that I, an engineer, am tasked with solving, to deliver beautiful user experiences.

When I'm not staring endlessly at my laptop and punching code into it, I spend my time reading and hanging out with my family and friends. I also enjoy anime and completing 3D puzzles.
